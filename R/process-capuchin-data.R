#' Determine presence of female in group
#'
#' This function uses census and biography data from the PACE database to
#' determine the periods of time females with specified minimum age
#' \code{minAgeF} were present in a \code{group} from \code{start} to
#' \code{end}.
#' The function does only work for females with known DOB
#'
#' @param census_pace Dataframe from the PACE database with monthly capuchin census data
#' @param biography_pace Dataframe from the PACE database with individual biography data
#' @param group The name of the social group for which the presence of females
#'   will be determined
#' @param start,end Define first and last day (YYYY-MM-DD) of the time period
#'   for which the presence of females will be determined
#' @param minAgeF The minimum age of females to be included (in years)
