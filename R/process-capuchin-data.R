#' Calculation of behavior rates for female dyads
#'

#' meeting specific criteria (age, focal effort) within a specified group and
#' time period (only works with one group and one time period at a time).
#'
#' @param behaviours_duration Behaviours with duration (e.g. grooming) to be
#'   included
#' @param beahviours_events Behaviours without duration (e.g. approach) to be
#'   included
#' @param minEffortDyad Minimum duration (in hours) a dyad has to be observed to
#'   be included (observation time of IndA while IndB was around + observation
#'   time IndB while IndA was around)
#' @param minEffortInd The minimum duration (in hours) an individual has to be
#'   observed to be included
#' @param roles_included Which roles should be included, e.g., (D)irected,
#'   (R)eceived, or (M)utual
#' @param dyads_summarized Should dyadic values be summarized? If FALSE, each
#'   behavior will be listed as IndA->IndB and as IndB->IndA separately (per
#'   dyad and per role)
#' @inheritParams determine_presence
#' @inheritParams calc_effort_AB
#'
#' @return If values are summarized, the rates IndA->IndB and IndB->IndA are
#'   averaged. This is slightly different from calculating behaviour counts (or
#'   durations) IndA->IndB + IndB->IndA divided by EffortA + EffortB (unless
#'   EffortA = EffortB). Thus, rates are not weighted by focal effort of IndA
